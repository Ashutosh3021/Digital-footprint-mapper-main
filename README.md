DFM is an OSINT tool that gathers public data, primarily from GitHub, to map a person’s digital footprint. It detects exposed personal details or leaked credentials, converts them into a visual intelligence graph, and reveals how attackers could reconstruct identity. Its goal is awareness, privacy protection, and reducing online security risks.
